    location:"Cathedral Provincial Park, B.C.",
    description: "It takes a day of hiking to get to this campground at the centre of Cathedral Provincial Park, in the Cascade Mountains west of B.C.’s Okanagan, but the park’s interior is worth it: a subalpine plateau of fish-filled lakes, unique geology, alpine meadows and, most importantly, plenty of hikeable summits and ridges. Day hikes project like spokes on a wheel from the campground, which sits on a turquoise lake across from impressive granite walls.",

    location:"Nopiming Provincial Park, Manitoba",
    description: "Quiet Nopiming Provincial Park possesses all the qualities of its southern neighbour, the Whiteshell, except for one—it doesn’t have too many visitors. The park’s lakes and rivers combine into excellent canoe routes through the Canadian Shield on the Manitoba-Ontario border. A woodland caribou herd wanders its northern reaches and moose and wolves are commonly seen. With only 36 sites, Tulabi is not only the closest campground in the park to Winnipeg but also the most private, with its own beach right on the Bird River canoe route.",

    location:"Killarney Provincial Park, Ontario",
    description: "Even if they’ve never been, most Canadians will recognize Killarney as the muse of the Group of Seven: the white quartzite hills, the gnarled jack pines and the incredibly clear blue lakes. “The Roof of Ontario”—located five hours north of Toronto—is famous for its excellent canoeing, but it also has plenty of scenic hikes and good sea kayaking. The best base is the George Lake campground, which sits near four lake-access points, the top trailheads and the small village of Killarney on Georgian Bay.",
